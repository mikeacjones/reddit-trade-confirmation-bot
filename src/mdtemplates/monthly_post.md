# How Does This Process Work?

> Note: Trade confirmations may take a few minutes as the bot processes the confirmation.

After completing a trade, adhering to the rules listed above, either party involved should make a top-level comment (i.e., comment on the post, not on someone else's comment) declaring the trade. In this comment, tag the other Redditor by typing their username, including the leading `u/`. This action serves a dual purpose: it notifies the other Redditor to confirm the trade, and it alerts `u/{bot_name}` to monitor for the confirmation. The other Redditor should then reply to this comment (i.e., do not create another top-level comment; instead, reply to the initial comment) to indicate that the trade was successful.

> **Important:** It's advisable to WAIT until the trade is successfully completed—meaning all money/items have been properly exchanged—before posting your confirmation.

Example:
1. `u/NitroFish44` comments: `Sold a Sailor S-Broad nib to u/thisisreallytricky`
2. `u/thisisreallytricky` replies: `Confirmed! Placed the nib in a more modern Sailor pen and LOVE the way it writes!!`
3. `u/{bot_name}` replies to `u/thisisreallytricky`'s comment indicating that their trade counts have been updated.

# FAQ

1. The bot mentioned that additional information is required. What should I do?
    > If this occurs, it suggests that the bot couldn't find enough information to confirm the trade. Please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2F{subreddit_name}), who can review and approve the trade by replying `Approved` to your trade comment.

2. The bot didn't respond to my comment. What's wrong?
    > Did you comment `Confirmed`? If not, add a NEW comment reply stating `Confirmed`. Avoid editing the existing comment. If you did reply `Confirmed` but received no response, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2F{subreddit_name}). The bot might be experiencing issues!
